# Water-Potability
This project uses machine learning to predict water potability based on physicochemical properties. It applies Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN models, achieving 65% accuracy with the Decision Tree. The study demonstrates how AI supports water quality and public health research.
